# Responsive Web Design Projects

This repository contains my projects from the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification, adapted to connect with real-world student needs at the school where I currently work.

ðŸ“‚ Projects

1. **Survey Form**  
   - **Description:** A form designed to help students select their school electives and clubs. Students can choose:
     - One **sport elective**
     - One **science elective**
     - One **art elective**
     - As many **clubs** as they would like to join  
   - This format mirrors the actual course and club selection process at the school.  
   - **Live Demo:** (add GitHub Pages link here once enabled)  
   - **Code:** [Survey Form Folder](./survey-form)

2. **Tribute Page**  
   - **Description:** A tribute page for Lance Reddick, created because the group of students I work with this year chose him as their hero and group leader. This page helps them present his life, values, and leadership qualities that they want their group to embody.  
   - **Live Demo:** (add GitHub Pages link here once enabled)  
   - **Code:** [Tribute Page Folder](./tribute-page)

More projects will be added here as I complete them!
