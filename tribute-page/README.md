# Tribute Page Project

This is the Tribute Page project completed as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification.

## Hero: Lance Reddick
The students I work with this year chose Lance Reddick as their group’s hero and leader figure.  
This tribute page was designed to help them present him as an inspiring role model and to highlight the values they admire in him — values they wanted their group to live by.
