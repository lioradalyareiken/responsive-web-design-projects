# Survey Form Project

This is the Survey Form project completed as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification, customized for use at the school where I work.  

## 🎯 Purpose
The form is designed to guide students in selecting their electives and clubs for the school year:
- One **sport elective**  
- One **science elective**  
- One **art elective**  
- Unlimited **clubs**  

This format matches the actual student selection process at the school, giving learners an accessible and organized way to make their choices.
